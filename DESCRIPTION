Description: A package for producing epidemic process and epidemic observation frameworks which can
	simulate realisations and calculate log likelihoods. Analysis of epidemic data can carried 
	out through various Pseudo-Marginal Methods, including Particle MCMC. This package is still
	in development and plans to include a much broader suite of epidemic models and analysis 
	methods.
